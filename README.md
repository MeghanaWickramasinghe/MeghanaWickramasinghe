**Biomedical Engineering Undergraduate | Biomedical Devices | Machine Learning | Human Motion Capture**

I’m Meghana Wickramasinghe, a Biomedical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa. I am interested in biomedical devices, data-driven healthcare solutions, and intelligent sensing systems, with a strong focus on applying engineering principles to real-world medical and rehabilitation applications.

In my research experience, I worked as a Research Intern at the NeuroBionics Laboratory at the University of Melbourne. My work focused on the design and development of an electronic pickup stick, emphasizing user-centered design and technical feasibility. I was involved in prototyping, testing, and validating hardware systems to ensure performance and reliability, while working closely with multidisciplinary research teams.

One of my major academic projects is CareAI, a data-driven disease prediction and early warning system. This project focuses on designing an integrated research-oriented framework for early disease prediction and clinical decision support. I contributed to developing scalable biomedical data pipelines, implementing machine learning–based analytical components, and building backend services, interactive dashboards, and a conversational chatbot interface.I have also worked on Exercise Mate, an exercise monitoring device based on human motion capture technologies. This project involved implementing Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithms for exercise recognition, integrating biomechanics data, and applying signal processing techniques to achieve accurate and efficient motion analysis.Another notable project is Med-Kit, a multifunctional vital parameter monitoring system. This portable IoT-based device enables real-time monitoring of SpO₂ and heart rate using custom-designed electronic circuits, secure data transmission, and regulatory-aware PCB design practices for biomedical applications.In addition, I was involved in the re-design of a human height measuring medical device with a strong emphasis on U.S. FDA regulatory compliance. This work included Class II medical device design controls, verification and validation processes, and the preparation of FDA-compliant documentation such as design history files and controlled design records.

In my academic background, I am currently pursuing a B.Sc. Engineering (Hons) in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Moratuwa with a GPA of 3.76. For the GCE Advanced Level examination, I obtained three A passes in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry, achieving an island rank of 398 out of 20,000+ candidates in Sri Lanka.

In my free time, I enjoy participating in extracurricular activities that complement my academic interests. I am a clarinet player and a former Western Band member at Newstead Girls’ College. I am also an active member of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBS) Student Chapter at the University of Moratuwa, where I have participated in technical events and supported student-led initiatives, including contributing to the organization and marketing of the IEEE EMBS Brainstorm Competition.
